### ‚ú® Featured Project: [RPG AI NPC Generator](https://github.com/daveedfaear-ops/rpg-ai-npc-generator)

This project is a prime example of my iterative prompt engineering process, demonstrating the creation of an AI-powered tool for tabletop Role-Playing Game Masters to generate on-the-fly Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

**Key Skills Demonstrated**:
*   **Advanced Prompt Design**: Crafting persona-driven prompts for creative, context-aware content (e.g., NPC personalities, backgrounds, gear).
*   **Structured Output (JSON)**: Engineering prompts to reliably output machine-readable JSON data.
*   **Python Integration**: Developing Python scripts to interact with LLM APIs (Google Gemini), parse structured outputs, and format them into user-friendly, readable text (e.g., using `textwrap` for optimal display).
*   **Iterative Testing & Refinement**: A methodical approach to diagnosing and resolving complex AI output issues (e.g., controlling response quantity, eliminating conversational filler, ensuring precise line-break formatting).
*   **Problem-Solving & Strategic Pivoting**: Adapting solutions, such as shifting from attempting freeform text formatting to a more robust JSON + Python post-processing workflow, to achieve reliable results.
*   **Technical Documentation**: Clearly outlining the project's purpose, development process, and execution instructions.
